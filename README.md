To understand and interact with ERC20 and ERC721 contract standards.   ERC20 tokens have been implemented in multiple use cases such as payment tokens, loyalty coins, gift cards, and so on but their most popular implementation by far is as Initial Crypto Offering (ICO) tokens.  ERC 721 is the token standard used to build smart contracts that issue Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Popular implementations include government documents, land titles, digital identities, and real estate.  The OpenZeppelin Solidity library provides smart contract templates for developing DApps. The OpenZeppelin framework consists of reusable contract code for Ethereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
